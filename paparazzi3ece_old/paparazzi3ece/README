Intro
-----

Paparazzi is an attempt to develop a cheap fixed wing UAV (Unmanned Air
Vehicle).  As of today we have successfully flown autonomously several small
electro powered fixed wing aircraft (Twinstar, Microjet, ...).

Up to date informations are available from the websites

	www.nongnu.org/paparazzi
	www.recherche.enac.fr/paparazzi

and from the mailing list and the IRC channem. Documentation is edited in
the wiki

	www.recherche.enac.fr/paparazzi/doc

Directories description:
-----------------------

conf: the configuration directory (airframe, radio, ... descriptions).

data: where to put read-only data (e.g. maps and terrain elevation files)

hw: hardware (electronic schemas, PCBs, ...)

sw: software (onboard, ground station, simulation, ...)

var: products of compilation, cache for the map tiles, ...

debian: Debian packaging control files


Required Software
-----------------
 - OCaml (ocaml.org), xml-light library (http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight)
 - gcc, GTK2, Glib2, libgnomecanvas, libxml2
 - AVR or ARM7 micro-controller development environnment (gcc, loader, libc, binutils)
 - ...

For Debian users: Required packages are available at

	http://www.recherche.enac.fr/paparazzi/debian

Installation of the meta-package "paparazzi-dev" will install everything
needed to compile this project (if something is missing, please ask)

Compilation
-----------

  1) "make" in the top directory

  2) "make demo" to run a demo (c.f. www.recherche.enac.fr/paparazzi/doc/moin.cgi/GettingStarted/Simulation)

  3) "make AIRCRAFT=<name> <target>.compile" compiles the airborne code for the specified target and aircraft

  4) "make AIRCRAFT=<name> sim" compiles the simulator for the specified aircraft.

  5) "make AIRCRAFT=<name> clean_ac" cleans files for the specified aircraft.

Uploading of the embedded software
----------------------------------

  1) Power the flight controller board. Plug the pc-link to the board.

  2) Upload with

	make AIRCRAFT=<name> fbw.upload		# Fly by wire
	make AIRCRAFT=<name> ap.upload		# Autopilot

  Important notes for bi-microcontroller avr boards:
     - The pclink must be switched accordingly with the target
     - The "fly by wire" controller cannot be uploaded when the
     "autopilot" controller is running. They cannot independently be
     modified; then an upload of the fly by wire usually requires

	make AIRCRAFT=<name> ap.erase
	make AIRCRAFT=<name> fbw.upload
 	make AIRCRAFT=<name> ap.upload


Running the ground segment monitoring
-------------------------------------

  1) "sw/supervision/paparazzi.pl" runs the ground control station supervision

  2) Choose the appropriate session
