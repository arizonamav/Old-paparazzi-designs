#### tiny_proto : first batch, christmas 2005 


+add supply measurement
+add crystal direction mark in library
+remove button pullup from under the button
+add a pullup for P0.14
+expose P0.23 for USB bootloader
+expose one IT on SPI connector to enable slave's notification (DRDY)
-improve serigraphy
+ make GPS middle pin bStop big enough
? maybe add possibility to solder lithium battery instead of gold cap, without adding a drill (with thermal) in the ground patch area
+ add tStop under the (rectangle) gps patch (not sure if it will help, but seen elsewhere)
- adjust LEA-xx dimension (part is taller than in .lbr)
- adjust LEA-xx pad width (pads are thinner than in .lbr)
+ (try Digikey patch antenna/adjust board to it)
+ use 13mm Sangshin antenna
+ make the board compatible with LEA-LA by adding GPS mode solder bridges : only for separate GPS boards
+ wire GPS reset : NO
+ make through-holes under LEA have tStop even on holes to prevent (rare) short circuit to LEA : use PCB varnish instead
+rewire 4015 on a single output compare
- add resitor bridge for USB_VBUS
+(GRZ) on serigraphy, replace
+ "S2" with "S0" on servo connector
+ "S3" with "S4" on servo connector
+ "S4" with "S5" on servo connector
- add a diode in the USB VBUS detection
###### tiny 0.99
